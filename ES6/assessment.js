// 1. How to preserve the immutability on my heroes list? Solve below problems using the same
// a. Get heroes who are not evils
// b. Print Unique family names
// c. Print Hero Names from given objects, and append sir in each of them before printing
// d. Do we have any hero in Marvel Family who is not evil
// e. 

// const heroes = [
//   { name: 'Wolverine',      family: 'Marvel',    isEvil: false },
//   { name: 'Deadpool',       family: 'Marvel',    isEvil: false },
//   { name: 'Magneto',        family: 'Marvel',    isEvil: true  },

// ]

//2. Give me an example of map and set collection each with at least four properties implemented - like get, set, clear, etc

//3. Create a promise object that get resloved after two seconds and rejected after three. Also it returns five ES6 features on resolved

//4. Using the promise object at #3 create an async and await feature

//5. Use the spread and rest operator to create a function which can multiple numbers from 1...n (n is the number of choice)
//   also need to print students of the session using same example

//6. Print the last name through destructuring and add a contact number:9119119110 as well
// const person = {
//     userDetails :{
//         first: "FirstName",
//         last: "LastName"
//     }
// }

//7. Give me an example of const data manipulation

//8. What is the difference between for-of and for-in show with examples

//9. There is a task where we need to make three server calls - named as signin, userregistration and nextpageToNavigate
//   all of them should contain a status code and status success or failed
//   Create three promises for the same and we need to make sure that we move the user to next page only when all the calls are succeeded

//10. In question number 9 we need to check the status of each promise and we can move to the next page even if nextpageToNavigate 
//   call gets failed however nothing should be done if first to fails, give me an example of cocurrent promises
//   with which we can achieve such scenarios
