// store is the data model/state management top level
// store will have collection of reducers

// define states - in the respective reducer file (User State =>  User Reducer)
// define updates in state - in the respective reducer file (User Actions to Updates =>  User Reducer)
// Actions raised from User Component => UserActions
// Action Types => this would be a common file
// Dispatchers => this we'll have once we subscribe the state or publish the action
// Action Creators => would be part of user action in UserComponents
